  <h1>About Chivis Bellas</h1>
  <p>Chivis Bellas was born from a love for creativity, fragrance, and elegant design. 
    Each candle we create is hand-poured with care, inspired by nature’s beauty and crafted to bring warmth and 
    personality into every space.  At Chivis Bellas, we believe that beauty lives in the details. What started as a small 
    passion project has grown into a heartfelt candle studio, where every piece is lovingly crafted by hand. Each candle 
    carries its own story—infused with delicate fragrances, shaped by creativity, and designed to bring a sense of calm 
    and charm into your home.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We aim to create beautifully scented candles that delight the senses, uplift the spirit, and transform everyday
     moments into something special—all while staying eco-conscious and handmade. Our mission at Chivis Bellas is to craft 
     candles that do more than light a room—they create moments. We blend artful design with inviting scents to turn 
     everyday spaces into calming sanctuaries. Each product is handmade with love, using eco-conscious materials,
    because beauty should never come at the expense of the earth.</p>

      <h2>Meet the Maker</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Silvia, the hands and heart behind Chivis Bellas. At Chivies Bellas, we believe that a candle is more than 
        just wax and wick — it's a moment, a memory, a mood. What began as a small passion project turned into a creative 
        space where fragrance, design, and simplicity meet.
        Every candle we pour is hand-crafted in small batches, using clean ingredients and thoughtful blends that evoke 
        calm, clarity, and comfort. From soft lavender evenings to citrus-lit mornings, each scent is designed to help you 
        slow down and reconnect with your space. Our goal? To create candles that don’t just light rooms — they warm hearts.
         Whether it’s a gift, a ritual, or a treat for yourself, we hope Luna Glow brings a little more glow into your every
          day.</p>
